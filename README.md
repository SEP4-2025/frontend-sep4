# GrowMate Frontend

## What is this repository

This repository contains the frontend application for the SEP4 project at VIA. It's a modern web application built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS that serves as the user interface for the GrowMate plant monitoring system. The frontend communicates with the backend services to display data collected from IoT sensors and provides user interaction capabilities.

## How to navigate

### React + Vite Application

The project follows a standard React + Vite application structure:

- `src/` - Contains the source code for the application
  - `src/App.jsx` - The main application component that includes the navbar
  - `src/assets/` - Contains static assets like images and icons
  - `src/index.css` - Contains global CSS and theme definitions
- `public/` - Contains static files that will be served directly
- `vite.config.js` - Configuration for the Vite build tool with tailwind integration
### Styling

The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling with:
- Custom theme values defined in the global CSS file
- Utility classes for responsive design
